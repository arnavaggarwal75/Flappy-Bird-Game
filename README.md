# Flappy Bird Game

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game in Java. The player controls the bird's vertical movement by making it "jump" to avoid colliding with the columns or the ground.

### Key Features

- **Game Mechanics:** Control the bird's movement using the spacebar or mouse clicks to navigate through columns.
- **Scoring System:** Earn points by successfully passing through columns.
- **Responsive Graphics:** The game features animated graphics and dynamic obstacle generation.

## Project Usage

The Flappy Bird game requires the player to navigate a bird through obstacles by making it jump at the right time. The game ends when the bird collides with a column or the ground. The player earns points by passing through the gaps between columns.
